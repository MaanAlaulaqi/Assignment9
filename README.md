# The Palindrome Effect -- Assignment 9


Simple program to find whether what the user inputs is a palindrome of sorts, or just another keysmash.
Accepts both numbers and letters, so go crazy.

## Usage 
`npm install` Installs server dependencies  
`npm start` Runs the app (app.js)   
`npm test` Runs tests  

## Using the app
The user will be asked to enter how long their entry will be.   
They will then be asked to enter each element's value, whatever they choose.    

Once all is said and done, the app will determine whether the user's entry is indeed a palindrome or not.
